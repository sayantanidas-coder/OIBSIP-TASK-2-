# BMI Calculator with History Tracking (TASK-2)

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** that provides a graphical interface for users to input their weight and height and instantly receive their BMI value along with a health classification. It also keeps track of BMI history for each user and visualizes this data using line charts. The goal is to make health monitoring easier, more engaging, and visually insightful.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust desktop application that enables users to calculate and track their Body Mass Index (BMI) over time. Unlike basic calculators, this system not only computes BMI but also maintains a personal history of BMI entries for each user and displays them graphically.

By combining a graphical user interface (GUI), persistent local storage, and data visualization, this project seeks to improve user engagement with health data and promote consistent weight monitoring practices. It is especially useful for individuals who are working towards fitness goals or managing health conditions that require regular tracking of body weight.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Tkinter for ease of use and a clean interface.
- **BMI Calculation**: Computes BMI using standard formula based on weight and height.
- **BMI Classification**: Categorizes the BMI result as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.
- **User-Specific Data Storage**: Saves data in a JSON file for each user with timestamps.
- **Visual History Tracking**: Uses Matplotlib to generate graphs showing the user's BMI history over time.
- **Dark-Themed UI**: Provides a modern, visually comfortable dark mode design.
- **Error Handling**: Validates user input and displays clear error messages if any field is invalid.

## Conclusion

This BMI Calculator application offers a meaningful improvement over traditional calculators by integrating data storage, historical tracking, and a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can now monitor their BMI regularly and visually understand trends in their body weight over time.

The project demonstrates how a simple health metric can be transformed into a useful and interactive application through careful design, data handling, and visualization. It serves as an excellent example of combining core Python with GUI and plotting libraries to deliver a user-centric solution. This project is also an ideal stepping stone for developers looking to explore more advanced desktop health applications.
